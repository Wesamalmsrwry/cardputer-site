# Frequently Asked Questions

## Can the Carputer do X?

While this device isn't the most powerful, with internet access and an additional Grove connector it can do a lot. You just need to be able to program it to do the thing. If you are unsure or just getting started, have a look around this wiki and hop on into [Discord][] to ask there.

## Does it have RFID/NFC?

No. But it does have an external grove connector (capable of I2C), so it is possible to add this functionality.

## Is the Cardputer an alternative to the Flipper Zero?

In our opinion, not really, at least not without modifications (like adding sub 1-ghz, rfid capability, ir receiver).

## Something else?

Come ask us on [Discord][].
